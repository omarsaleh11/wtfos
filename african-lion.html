                    <h1>African lion</h1>
                    <p>African lions have been admired throughout history for as symbols of courage and strength. These
                        iconic animals have
                        powerful bodies—in the cat family, they’re second in size only to tigers—and roars that can be
                        heard from five miles
                        away. An adult lion’s coat is yellow-gold, and juveniles have some light spots that disappear
                        with age. Only male lions
                        typically boast manes, the impressive fringe of long hair that encircles their heads.</p>

                    <h1>Habitat <span>of </span>Lions</h1>
                    <p>
                        African lions once roamed most of Africa and parts of Asia and Europe. But the species has
                        disappeared from 94 percent
                        of its historic range and can only be found today in parts of sub-Saharan Africa. These lions
                        mainly stick to the
                        grasslands, scrub, or open woodlands where they can more easily hunt their prey, but they can
                        live in most habitats
                        aside from tropical rainforests and deserts.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Lions<span> and </span>Groups</h1>
                    <p>
                        Lions are the only cats that live in groups, which are called prides—though there is one
                        population of solitary lions.
                        Prides are family units that may comprise anywhere from two to 40 lions—including up to to three
                        or four males, a dozen
                        or so females, and their young. All of a pride's lionesses are related, and female cubs
                        typically stay with the group as
                        they age. Young males eventually leave and establish their own prides by taking over a group
                        headed by another male.
                    </p>
                    <div class="info">
                        <h1><span>Male</span> Jobs</h1>
                        <p>
                            Males defend the pride's territory, marking the area with urine, roaring menacingly to warn
                            intruders, and chasing off
                            animals that encroach on their turf.
                        </p>
                        <h1><span>Female</span> Jobs</h1>
                        <p>
                            Female lions are the pride's primary hunters and leaders. They often work together to prey
                            upon antelopes, zebras,
                            wildebeest, and other large animals of the open grasslands. Many of these animals are faster
                            than lions, so teamwork
                            pays off. Female lions also raise their cubs communally.
                        </p>
                        <h1>Lions<span> and </span>Hunting</h1>
                        <p>
                            After the hunt, the group effort often degenerates to squabbling over the sharing of the
                            kill, with cubs at the bottom
                            of the pecking order. Young lions do not help to hunt until they are about a year old. Lions
                            will hunt alone if the
                            opportunity presents itself, and they also steal kills from hyenas or wild dogs.
                        </p>
                        <h1>Threats<span> to </span> Survival</h1>
                        <p>
                            Today, there are only half as many African lions than there were 25 years ago. The
                            International Union for the
                            Conservation of Nature (IUCN) estimates that fewer than 25,000 lions remain in Africa, which
                            is why the organization
                            classifies them as vulnerable to extinction.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            African lions face a variety of threats—most of which can be attributed to humans. Fearing
                            that lions will prey on their
                            livestock, which can be a significant financial blow, ranchers may kill the animals both in
                            retaliation and as a
                            preventative measure, sometimes using pesticides as poison. Poachers target the species,
                            too, as their bones and other
                            body parts are valuable in the illegal wildlife trade.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The role trophy hunting plays is controversial. Mismanaged hunting in the past has caused
                            lions to disappear from some
                            habitats, while hunters and those involved in the industry say hunting fees generate money
                            for lion conservation.
                            National Geographic Explorer Craig Packer, however, has said the amount generated by hunting
                            is so "underwhelming…[that]
                            it’s no wonder that despite years of lion hunting being allowed in [some] countries, the
                            lion population has plummeted."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Further fueling this conflict between lions and humans is the loss of prey across the
                            species’ range. African lions prey
                            on large herbivores, a population that’s being hunted for an increasingly commercial
                            bushmeat trade. The IUCN estimates
                            these populations have declined by as much as 52 percent in East Africa and 85 percent in
                            West Africa. With less food
                            available in the wild, lions may be more likely to turn to hunting domesticated animals like
                            livestock.
                        </p>
                        <h1>Conservation<span> on </span>Lions</h1>
                        <p>
                            Helping humans learn how to live with lions is key to ensuring their survival. Conservation
                            organizations are working to
                            change attitudes toward lions through compensation initiatives. Some of these models offer
                            communities financial rewards
                            when their local lion populations rise, while others pay farmers to replace their livestock
                            that have been killed by
                            lions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Other conservationists have focused on creating protected areas for lions. In Botswana’s
                            Selinda area, only a single
                            lioness and her cub lived there when filmmakers Dereck and Beverly Joubert, both National
                            Geographic Explorers, turned
                            the land into a protected reserve and photographic tourism camp. Now about a hundred lions
                            roam the reserve.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In Mozambique’s Zambezi Delta, where the effects of a protracted civil war caused lion
                            numbers to plummet, the
                            largest-ever lion translocation project brought in 24 lions from South Africa in
                            2018—they’re now settled in and
                            starting to have cubs.
