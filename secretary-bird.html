                    <h1>Secretary birds</h1>
                    <p>These raptors of sub-Saharan Africa’s savannas, grasslands, and shrub lands stand at nearly four
                        feet tall—and standing
                        is often how you’ll find them, because they primarily move around on foot. They fly only when
                        necessary, such as to
                        reach their nest in the trees and for courtship displays.</p>

                    <h1>Body <span>of </span>Secretary</h1>
                    <p>
                        The secretary bird is distinguished by its long legs and a dramatic black crest of feathers on
                        the back of its head. Its
                        body is covered in whitish-gray feathers, with two long, black-tipped tail feathers. Its bare
                        face is usually yellow,
                        orange or red.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The top half of its long legs has black feathers, so it looks a bit like it’s wearing bicycle
                        shorts. The lower half is
                        covered with scales and has barely visible feathers.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Name <span>of</span> Bird</h1>
                    <p>
                        While it’s not known for certain where the name “secretary bird” comes from, one explanation is
                        that they’re named after
                        19th lawyer’s clerks, or secretaries. Secretaries typically wore gray coats and knee-length
                        black pants, and they would
                        tuck quill pens behind their ears, similar to the bird’s coloring and head feather
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another theory is that “secretary bird” is an English-language corruption of saqr
                        et-tair—roughly meaning “hunter bird”
                        in Arabic—a phrase one traveler claims to have heard Arabic-speaking people in Sudan call it.
                        That explanation, however,
                        has been called into doubt by some experts.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Diet<span> of </span>Secretary bird</h1>
                    <p>Secretary birds and caracaras are the only two birds of prey that hunt on the ground instead of
                        from the air. Secretary
                        birds’ diets consist of small rodents, amphibians, and reptiles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Snakes are a favorite meal, and in fact, the bird’s scientific name, Sagittarius serpentarius,
                        means “the archer of
                        snakes.” If a snake tries striking a secretary bird, it usually ends up with a mouthful of
                        feathers from the bird’s
                        almost seven-foot wingspan, which it uses as a distraction. The scales on their lower legs
                        provide additional protection
                        from snakebites.
                    </p>
                    <div class="info">
                        <h1>Hunting<span></span> Ways</h1>
                        <p>
                            Working in small groups or with a partner, secretary birds hunt from just after dawn through
                            to the evening, resting
                            only during the peak heat of the afternoon. They sometimes capture prey by striking at it
                            with their short, hooked
                            beaks, but more famously, secretary birds use their large feet and sharp claws to stomp it
                            to death.
                        </p>
                        <h1>Mating<span> and </span>The Bird</h1>
                        <p>Mating displays take place both in the air and on the ground. They perform aerial courtship
                            displays, similar to other
                            raptors, called “pendulum flights.” The bird will swoop down, then up again, repeating the
                            undulating pattern over and
                            over. Sometimes one will dive at the other, who will roll backward in the air, presenting
                            its claws.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the ground, a pair may dance around each other, wings outstretched, in a display similar
                            to that of cranes. Sometimes
                            other secretary birds will join in.
                        </p>
                        <h1>Nest <span>of </span>Secretary</h1>
                        <p>
                            Mating pairs build nest of sticks together, usually in an acacia tree. They’ll use the same
                            nest for years, continuing
                            to add to it season after season.
                        </p>
                        <h1>Parents Job</h1>
                        <p>
                            The female usually lays three blue-green eggs, which both parents incubate. When the eggs
                            hatch after about 50 days,
                            both parents care for the chicks, including feeding them regurgitated prey. The young birds
                            fledge after about three
                            months.
                        </p>
                        <h1>Threats</h1>
                        <p>
                            Human encroachment on secretary birds’ natural habitat has led the species to be classified
                            as vulnerable to extinction.
                            Some of its grasslands habitat has been burned and cleared for livestock. Those open areas
                            leave little protection for
                            prey animals, making it hard for secretary birds to find food. Some secretary birds can make
                            do in human-created open
                            areas by scavenging small animals that didn’t escape the fires or other predators. The
                            presence of humans—mainly
                            herders—is known to interfere with secretary bird breeding.
                        </p>
                        <h1>Conservation</h1>
                        <p>
                            Secretary birds can be found in a number of protected areas across their large range, but
                            scientists say better
                            monitoring is needed to track their numbers and quantify their decline in some areas.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Citizens should not be selfish and not burn other beings' homes
                        </p>
                        <h1><span>Are Secretary Birds</span> Cannibalism!??</h1>
                        <p>
                            With short answer no , and you rarely see article talking about that , and that because they
